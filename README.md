# Registered Reports in Primate Neurophysiology
***Working out how to make the [registered report format](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports) work for primate neurophysiology, as part of [OLS-2](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2).***

Here's where I'll be tracking progress on the project throughout the OLS program: [link](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-2/issues/28).


## [Vision Statement](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/stating-your-project-vision/)

Iâ€™m working with neurophysiologists and metascientists to create a guide to using the registered report format specifically for those in our field so that we can reap the benefits of the format (peer review in advance of data collection, and reducing publication bias).
