# Registered-Reports-in-Primate-Neurophysiology

## [Vision Statement](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/stating-your-project-vision/)

Iâ€™m working with neurophysiologists and metascientists to create a guide to using the registered report format specifically for those in our field so that we can reap the benefits of the format (peer review in advance of data collection, and reducing publication bias).
