This is the first draft of a survey which would potentially be sent out to researchers to help understand the current usage of RRs, and barriers to usage of RRs.

Accompanying text:

I am a researcher at the National Institutes of Health, conducting a project with the goal of extending the use of the registered report format within the field of primate neurophysiology. I am currently conducting a survey in order to gain an understanding of current opinion on RRs in the field, and the barriers to usage (both general and specific to this field).

I got your details by ...

The survey should take roughly X minutes.

The results of this survey will be... (if you choose to part please indicate if you would like your contribution to be attributed to you or for anonymization to be attempted).

-----------

1. Have you heard of *registered reports* before?
	- Yes. Go to question 2.
	- No. Go to question 3.

2. Have you used a registered report format to report your work before?
	- Yes. Go to Q5.
	- No. Go to Q4.

3. Registered reports are...
	Further resources are available at X.
	Go to Q4.

4. Would you consider using a registered report format for reporting your work in the future?
	- Yes
	- No
	- Not sure

5. Rate the following concerns (how to rate?):
These are things that people often express as concerns. How many of these would you say are concerns of yours.
	- Front-loading of beurocracy
	- Stifling of creativity
	- Investing time in a project before the outcome is known

(perhaps there is a list of FAQ/common concerns that I could draw on?)

## Info on RRs

A registered report is a reporting style whereby a manuscript is submitted to a journal before data collection occurs. It looks like a normal manuscript, apart from that the results section is missing, and the data analysis section has a data analysis plan or analysis of simulated data instead of a data analysis on real data.
