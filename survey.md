This is the first draft of a survey which would potentially be sent out to researchers to help understand the current usage of RRs, and barriers to usage of RRs.

Accompanying text:

I am interested in understanding current opinion on RRs in the field of X, and understanding the barriers to adoption.  

1. Have you heard of *registered reports* before?
	- If yes, have you reported your own work in the format?
		- If no, why?
	- If no, information on RRs, and link to further reading
		- After reading this would you consider using a registered report format for reporting your work in the future?

## Info on RRs

A registered report is a reporting style whereby a manuscript is submitted to a journal before data collection occurs. It looks like a normal manuscript, apart from that the results section is missing, and the data analysis section has a data analysis plan or analysis of simulated data instead of a data analysis on real data.
